/**//*Here's a detailed explanation of each line:

            1. import (link unavailable)*; - Imports all classes and methods from the (link unavailable) package, which provides input/output functionality.

            2. import java.util.Scanner; - Imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which provides a simple way to read input from the user.

3. public class Solution { - Declares a public class named Solution, which is required by the problem statement.

            4. public static void main(String[] args) { - Declares the main method, which is the entry point of the program.

        5. Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); - Creates a new Scanner object to read input from the standard input (System.in).

        6. int i = scanner.nextInt(); - Reads an integer from the standard input using the nextInt method and stores it in variable i.

        7. System.out.println(i); - Prints the value of i to the standard output (System.out) using the println method.

        8. int j = scanner.nextInt(); and int k = scanner.nextInt(); - Read two more integers from the standard input and store them in variables j and k, respectively.

        9. System.out.println(j); and System.out.println(k); - Print the values of j and k to the standard output.

        10. scanner.close(); - Closes the Scanner object to prevent resource leaks and free up system resources.
